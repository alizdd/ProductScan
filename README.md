<h1>Solidity - Original product tracking information system with QR code</h1>

It is a study that includes the follow-up, sale and purchase of the product added to the smart contract by the manufacturer or supplier. A web interface has been designed that generates a square barcode with the ID number of the added product and provides information about product information and originality as a result of barcode scanning.
